# 3d-Printing
Collection of 3d printer mods.

Place holder for X5SA Pro EVA 3.0 toolhead mod.
mod is based on the Heat Insert EVA 3.0 project located at https://main.eva-3d.page/

The insert size EVA is modeled for is M3 x D4.6 x L4.0 but this does not have to be exact, i.e. D5.0 or L5.0 inserts should work as well, just might require a bit of clean up of the plastic that's pushed out.
